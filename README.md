# VaporDesign

This is a design system is an ongoing project to create an attractive library of components to be used in hi-fi interactive mobile prototypes in FramerX.

## Installation

To use these components in your FramerX projects you must open a new framer project and create new code component. Use the "command + alt + p" shortcut to open the container folder for your framer project. Drag that folder into your code editor and install 'styled-components' with the npm command:

```
npm install styled-components
```
